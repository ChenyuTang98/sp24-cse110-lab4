1. What was the bug?
    the bug is inputs are strings instead of numbers, so if passed into function, will perform string concatenation instead of calculation.

2. How would you fix it? Include a screenshot of your fix. Name it fix.png (or whatever image extension you would like to use) and add it to your expand/screenshots directory.
   I have attached the fix.png in the folder. I added Number() to input, so they can be converted to numbers before calculation.
